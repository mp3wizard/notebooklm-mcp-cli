"""Service layer for auth.

Thin re-export of auth-related symbols from `core.auth` so the MCP/CLI
layers can satisfy the layering rule (`cli/` and `mcp/` must not import
from `core/`). Business logic, validation, and error handling for auth
live in `notebooklm_tools.core.auth`; this module is intentionally a
shim and adds no behavior of its own.

Three mechanisms are used to preserve test monkeypatching of the
underlying `core.auth` symbols:

1. **Function wrappers** (`check_auth`, `load_cached_tokens`,
   `save_tokens_to_cache`, `get_cache_path`, `validate_cookies`) resolve
   the implementation lazily on every call. This is the same pattern
   that would otherwise silently fail if the symbol were captured at
   import time.

2. **PEP 562 module-level `__getattr__`** for the two class symbols
   (`AuthTokens`, `AuthManager`). Each attribute access re-exports
   the class from `core.auth` lazily, so `from notebooklm_tools.
   services.auth import AuthManager` inside a test function (after a
   `monkeypatch.setattr` of `core.auth.AuthManager`) still picks up the
   patched class. Since we resolve the same `core.auth.X` each time,
   `isinstance(x, services.auth.AuthManager)` continues to return True
   for instances constructed via the shim.

3. **No re-export of internal helpers** (`AuthManager.list_profiles`,
   etc.) — the shim is intentionally a thin surface that the layering
   rule is allowed to grow into. Anything not listed in `__all__` or
   resolved via `__getattr__` is intentionally absent.

    The CLI/MCP codebase stores auth in two layouts that can coexist:

    - **Modern (multi-profile):** `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/profiles/<name>/cookies.json`
      for each profile `<name>` in the profiles directory.
    - **Legacy (single-profile):** `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/auth.json` at the
      storage root, used by older installs and some MCP clients.

    The auth-guard mtime check needs to invalidate on a write to ANY of
    these files, not just the one for the "default" profile — because the
    active profile for a given MCP/CLI session can be overridden with
    `--profile`, while the config-level `default_profile` stays put. If
    we only watched the config-default profile's file, an external
    `nlm login --profile <other>` would silently fail to invalidate the
    guard (live-testing caught this exact bug in v0.6.15 prep).

    This function stats every `cookies.json` under `profiles/`, the
    legacy `auth.json` at the storage root, and returns the max mtime.
    A write to any of them invalidates the guard. Returns 0.0 if no auth
    file exists yet (sentinel for "no cache yet").

    Catches all exceptions and returns 0.0 on error: a wrong mtime answer
    is far less harmful than a 500 on `studio_create` from an unrelated
    config error.
